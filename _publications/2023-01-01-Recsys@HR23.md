title: "Counterfactual Representations for Intersectional Fair Ranking in Recruitment"
authors: 'Clara Rus, Maarten de Rijke and Andrew Yates'
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'Fairness interventions require access to sensitive attributes of candidates applying for a job, which might not be available due to limitations imposed by data protection laws. In this work we propose using a pre-processing technique to create counterfactual representations of the candidates that lead to a more diverse ranking with respect to intersectional groups.'
